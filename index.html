 whispering
As I pass myself down to my knees.
whispering
As I fall through the willow trees, and I said.

Who will care for the falling?
... leaves?

 whispering
As I fall through the willow trees, and I said.

Who will care for the falling?

Autumn shades, calm my shaking hands,
Tender, cool breeze, keeps me where I am.
Suddenly here, when I want to scream,
Autumn calms me down, keeps me in my dreams.

Then I went  whispering
As I pass myself down to my knees.
whispering, those dew drops are glistening,
As I fall through the willow trees, and I said.

Who would care for the falling?

Keep on falling down, they keep on falling down,
